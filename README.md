## Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) Extension to Lentivirus-GLUE

<img src="md/horse-droplet.png" align="right" alt="" width="220" />

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Lentivirus-GLUE-EIAV**: an extension to **[Lentivirus-GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE)**.

Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) infects horses, mules, and donkeys, causing a persistent infection characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, anemia, and weight loss. The virus is primarily transmitted through blood-feeding insects like horseflies and deerflies, which mechanically transfer the virus between animals. EIAV exhibits high genetic variability, enabling it to evade the host immune response and persist for the lifetime of the host. While some infected horses develop severe clinical signs, others remain asymptomatic carriers, posing a risk of transmission to other animals. Diagnosis is commonly achieved through serological testing, such as the Coggins test, which detects antibodies against the virus. Control measures include rigorous testing and quarantine, as no vaccine or cure exists for EIAV, making it a significant concern for equine health and industry biosecurity worldwide.

The EIAV extension to EIAV-GLUE incorporates all published EIAV sequence data linked to associated metadata, including information that is sequence-associated (length, publication date); taxonomic (viral genotype, subtype); and isolate-associated (isolation host species, date and location of sampling, isolation source).

## Data Sources

**Lentivirus-GLUE-EIAV** is constructed using sequence data obtained from [NCBI Nucleotide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore).
